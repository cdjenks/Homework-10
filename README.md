## <a name="description"></a>Project Description

As a member of a team, I believe it is important to have basic useful information about each of team member available in a single location. This application generates a nicely formatted html file with the team information provided by the user.

## <a name="installation"></a>Installation

Run the command "npm install" once you have the application folder on your device and have navigated to the folder in your terminal.

## <a name="usage"></a>Usage

The application is initiated by running "node app.js" in your terminal. This will start the cycle of questions which allows as many team members as needed to be entered. Once there are no more members to add, the generated html file will be pushed to the "output" subfolder.

## <a name="tests"></a>Tests

After installing, you can run "npm test' in the terminal to confirm that input to the application will be formatted correctly to then be rendered into the html file.
